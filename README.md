# PICO_terminal-emulator
Simple C terminal emulator made for raspberry pico WH (may be compatible with pico standard and pico 2 series)


# Edit
You can add "commands" by simply adding functions to the program, then modify the "switch-case" loop in the "what_command" function with the 2-keyboard keys reference of your new command (which you can figure out by running the script on your pico device and by pressing CTRL-D you can enter debug mode, keyboard keys will be printed in their digital form.)

# Compile and Build
I recommend you to use the Visual Studio Code raspberry pico SDK extension.
